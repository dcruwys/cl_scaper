Python Craglist Ticket Scraper
==========================
takes city and event name and returns an array of events

Uses beautiful soup and requests, based off of Greg Reda's scraper
(http://www.gregreda.com/2014/07/27/scraping-craigslist-for-tickets/)

Not really usable because it violates CL's TOS but a good test of beautiful soup and requests
